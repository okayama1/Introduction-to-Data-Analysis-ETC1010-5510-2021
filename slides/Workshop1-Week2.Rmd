# Tidy Data
```{r clean-data-img, echo = FALSE, output = "55%"}
include_graphics("images/cleaning-data.jpg")
```
.blockquote[
You're ready to sit down with a newly-obtained dataset, excited about how it will open a world of insight and understanding, and then find you can't use it. You'll first have to spend a significant amount of time to restructure the data to even begin to produce a set of basic descriptive statistics or link it to other data you've been using.

# Tidy Data

```{r clean-data-img-2, echo = FALSE, output = "75%"}
include_graphics("images/cleaning-data.jpg")
```


.blockquote[
"Tidy data" is a term meant to provide a framework for producing data that conform to standards that make it easier to use. Tidy data may still require some cleaning for analysis, but the job will be much easier.

# Data wrangling using tidyverse
<br><br>

[tidyverse info](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/)

<br>

.content-box-neutral[
- Allow us to filter data
- Calculate summaries of the data
- Create new variables
- Change the way in which the data is organized
- Much more!
]

---
# The pipe operator: `%>%`
<br><br>


- The .green[pipe operator] help us .greenc[connect "commands"] in the tidyverse universe.
- It is extremely useful
- It provides an easy way to create tidy code

.content-box-neutral[
The symbol .purple[%>%] is referred to as the .green["pipe operator"]:
]


---
# The The pipe operator: `%>%`
<br><br>

- You can think of it .green[as an operator that allow us to connect operations:]

```{r , eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
data %>%
  select(age, height, hair_colour) %>% 
  filter(hair_colour == "ginger")

```

Use the .green[data] file , THEN (.purple[%>% ]) .purple[select] the variables (columns), age, height, and hair_colour THEN (.purple[%>% ])  .purple[filter] so we only retain rows which have hair_color equal to "ginger"

- .purple[%>% ] -->  .green[It passes the output along to the next function]

# Example: US graduate programs
<br><br>
.green[Data from a study on US grad programs.] 

- Originally came in an excel file containing rankings of many different programs. 
- Contains information on four programs:
  1. Astronomy
  1. Economics
  1. Entomology, and 
  1. Psychology

---

# Example: US graduate programs

```{r readgrad, echo = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
grad <- read_csv("data/graduate-programs.csv")
grad
```

---
# Example: US graduate programs
<br><br>
Good things about the format:

.pull-left[
```{r print-grad, echo = FALSE}
head(grad)
```
]
.pull-right[

.green[**Rows**] contain information about the institution

.green[**Columns**] contain types of information, like average number of publications, average number of citations, % completion, 
]

---

# Example: US graduate programs

<br><br>
Easy to make summaries:

<br>

```{r , echo = TRUE}
unique(grad$subject)
```

```{r grad-count, echo = TRUE}
grad %>% count(subject)
```





---

# Example: US graduate programs
<br><br>
.green[Using the .green[dplyr] it is easy to filter data and calculate summary statistics:]
<br>

```{r grad-filter, echo = TRUE}
grad %>%
  filter(subject == "economics") %>%
  summarise(
    mean = mean(NumStud), 
    s = sd(NumStud)
  )
```

The .green[dplyr] package is part of the .green[tidyverse] package.

---

# Example: US graduate programs
<br><br>
The .green[package --> ggplot2 which is part of the tidyverse] (we will learn more about ploting
next week!)
<br><br>

.pull-left[

Easy to make a plot


```{r grad-plot, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
grad %>%
  filter(subject == "economics") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = NumStud,
             y = MedianTimetoDegree)) +
  geom_point() + 
  theme(aspect.ratio = 1)
```

.pull-right[
```{r gra-dplot-out, ref.label = 'grad-plot', echo = FALSE, out.height= "100%"}

# Terminology of data: Variable
<br><br>
.content-box[
- A quantity, quality, or property that you can measure. 
- For the grad programs, these would be all the .green[column headers].
]

```{r show-grad}
grad
```

---
# Terminology of data: Observation
<br><br>
.content-box[
- A set of measurements made under similar conditions
- Contains several values, each associated with a different variable.
- For the grad programs, this is institution, and program, .green[uniquley define the observation].
]

```{r show-grad-again}
grad
```


---
# Terminology of data: Value
<br><br>

.content-box[
- Is the state of a variable when you measure it. 
- The value of a variable typically changes from observation to observation.
- For the grad programs, this is the value in .green[each cell.]
]

```{r show-grad-again-again}
grad
```


---
# Tidy tabular form
<br><br>
.green[**Tabular data**] is a set of values, each associated with a variable and an observation. Tabular data is .green[**tidy**] iff (if and only if):
<br><br>
.content-box[
* Each variable in its own column, 
* Each observation in its own row,
* Each value is placed in its own `cell`.

# Messy vs tidy

.pull-left[
Messy data is messy in its own way. You can make unique solutions, but then another data set comes along, and you have to again make a unique solution. 
```{r , echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
include_graphics("images/lego.png")
```
]

.pull-right[
Tidy data can be though of as legos. Once you have this form, you can put it together in so many different ways, to make different analyses.

```{r img-lego, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
include_graphics("images/lego.png")

Roughly, replicate 4 is like replicate 1, eg if one is low, the other is low. 

That's a good thing, that the replicates are fairly similar.

# Style guide
<br><br>
> "Good coding style is like correct punctuation: you can manage without it, butitsuremakesthingseasiertoread." -- Hadley Wickham

- Style guide for this course is based on the Tidyverse style guide: http://style.tidyverse.org/
- There's more to it than what we'll cover today, we'll mention more as we introduce more functionality, and do a recap later in the semester

---
# Long lines
<br><br>

.content-box-neutral[
- Limit your code to 80-100 characters per line. This fits comfortably on a printed page with a reasonably sized font.
- Take advantage of RStudio editor's auto formatting for indentation at line breaks.
]


---
# File names and code chunk labels
<br><br>
.content-box[
- Do not use spaces in file names, use `-` or `_` to separate words
- Use all lowercase letters
]

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Good
ucb-admit.csv

# Bad
UCB Admit.csv
```

---
# Object names
<br><br>

.content-box[
- Use `_` to separate words in object names
- Use informative but short object names
- Do not reuse object names within an analysis
]

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Good
acs_employed

# Bad
acs.employed
acs2
acs_subset
acs_subsetted_for_males
```

---
# Spacing

.content-box[
- Put a space before and after all infix operators (=, +, -, <-, etc.), and when naming arguments in function calls. 
- Always put a space after a comma, and never before (just like in regular English).
]

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Good
average <- mean(feet / 12 + inches, na.rm = TRUE)

# Bad
average<-mean(feet/12+inches,na.rm=TRUE)
```

---
# ggplot recap

<br><br>
- Always end a line with `+`
- Always indent the next line

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
 # Good
ggplot(diamonds, mapping = aes(x = price)) +
  geom_histogram()

# Bad
ggplot(diamonds,mapping=aes(x=price))+geom_histogram()
```


---
# Assignment

<br><br>

- Use `<-` not `=`

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Good
x <- 2

# Bad
x = 2
```

---
# Quotes

<br><br>

Use `"`, not `'`, for quoting text. The only exception is when the text already contains double quotes and no single quotes.

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
ggplot(diamonds, mapping = aes(x = price)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  # Good
  labs(title = "`Shine bright like a diamond`",
  # Good
       x = "Diamond prices",
  # Bad
       y = 'Frequency')

dim(avail_pkg)
```

As of `r Sys.Date()` there are `r nrow(avail_pkg)` R packages available


---
# Many R packages

<br><br>
- A blessing & a curse! 
- So many packages available, it can make it hard to choose!
- Many of the packages are designed to solve a specific problem
- The tidyverse is designed to work with many other packages following a consistent philosophy
- What this means is that you shouldn't notice it!

<br>
There can be conflicts between function names. 
For example, there is a `filter` function in the `stats` package 
that comes with the R distribution. 

---

# Name clashes
<br><br>
This can cause confusion when
you want to use the filter function in `dplyr` (part of tidyverse).
To be sure the function you use is the one you want to use, you can
prefix it with the package name `dplyr::filter()`.
<br>

```{r print-tidyverse, message = TRUE, include = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r name, eval = FALSE, message = TRUE, include = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
data <- dplyr::select(variable)

# Background on the data

- This was an actual experiment in Food Sciences at Iowa State University. The goal was to find out if some cheaper oil options could be used to make hot chips: that people would not be able to distinguish the difference between chips fried in the new oils relative to those fried in the current market leader.

- Twelve tasters were recruited to sample two chips from each batch, over a period of ten weeks. The same oil was kept for a period of 10 weeks! May be a bit gross by the end!

- This data set was brought to R by Hadley Wickham, and was one of the problems that inspired the thinking about tidy data, and the evolution of the `tidyverse` tools. 


---

# Example: french fries

<br><br>
.green[Experiment in Food Sciences at Iowa State University.]

- .green[**Aim**]: find if cheaper oil could be used to make hot chips
- .green[Question]: Can people distinguish between chips fried in the new oils relative to those current market leader oil?
- 12 tasters recruited 
- Each sampled two chips from each batch
- Over a period of ten weeks.

Same oil kept for a period of 10 weeks!

               values_to = "rating") %>%
  mutate(type = as.factor(type))

We write .green["type"] and .green["rating"] in quotes 
because we are creating the variables.

# `filter()`

Choose observations (certain rows) from your data

# `filter()`: example
.code[
```{r ff-filter-subj, echo = TRUE}

]


---
# `filter()`: details
<br><br>
Filtering requires comparison to find the subset of observations of interest.  What do you think the following mean?

- `subject != 10` 
- `x > 10` 
- `x >= 10` 
- `class %in% c("A", "B")` 
- `!is.na(y)`



---
# `filter()`: details

`subject != 10`

Find rows corresponding to all subjects except subject 10

 `x > 10` 


find all rows where variable `x` has values bigger than 10

`x >= 10` 


 finds all rows variable `x` is greater than or equal to 10.

`class %in% c("A", "B")`


 finds all rows where variable `class` is either A or B

`!is.na(y)` 


finds all rows that *DO NOT* have a missing value for variable `y`

- `select()` subject through to rating
- drop subject


```{r ff-example-select, eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
fries_long %>% select(time,
                      treatment,
                      rep)

```

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
fries_long %>%
  select(subject:rating)
```


```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
fries_long %>%
  select(-subject)
```

# Using `summarise()` + `group_by()`

Produce summaries for every group:

# Let's practice

- Compute the average rating by subject

```{r ff-grouped-summary, echo = TRUE}
fries_long %>% 
  group_by(subject) %>%
  summarise(rating = mean(rating, na.rm=TRUE))
```

# Another example

.pull-left[
- Compute the average rancid rating per week
]

```{r ff-grouped-summary-time, echo = TRUE}
fries_long %>% 
  filter(type == "rancid") %>%
  group_by(time) %>%
  summarise(rating = mean(rating, na.rm=TRUE))

# Your turn: french-fries.Rmd - arrange

- Arrange the average rating by type in decreasing order

```{r fries-arrange-summarise , echo = TRUE}
fries_long %>% 
  group_by(type) %>%
  summarise(rating = mean(rating, na.rm=TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(rating))
```

# `arrange()` answers

- Arrange the average subject rating in order lowest to highest.

```{r fries-arrange-summarise-subject, echo = TRUE}
fries_long %>% 
  group_by(subject) %>%
  summarise(rating = mean(rating, na.rm=TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(rating)

The scales of the ratings are quite different. Mostly the chips are rated highly on potato's, but low on grassy.

# French Fries: Are ratings similar?

```{r plot-fries-type-rating , echo = TRUE}
ggplot(fries_long,
       aes(x = type, 
           y = rating)) +
  geom_boxplot()

<br><br>

```{r fries-spread-summarise, echo = TRUE}
summarise(fries_spread,
          r = cor(`1`, `2`, use = "complete.obs"))
```
.green[Correlation] is measure of similarity (you will learn more about it in other units!)
Correlation takes values between -1 and 1.

# French Fries

```{r fries-spread-plot, out.width= "80%" , echo = TRUE}
  ggplot(fries_spread,
         aes(x = `1`, 
             y = `2`)) + 
  geom_point() +

```{r fries-group-summarise-cor, echo = TRUE}
fries_spread %>%
  group_by(type) %>%
  summarise(r = cor(x = `1`, 
                    y = `2`, 
                    use = "complete.obs"))

# French Fries: Replicates by rating type

```{r plot-fries-facet-type, out.width = "70%", echo = TRUE}
ggplot(fries_spread, aes(x=`1`, y=`2`)) + 
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~type, ncol = 5)
```

Potato and buttery have better replication than the other scales,
but there is still a lot of variation from rep 1 to 2.
