# Intuition: The trick of making graphs 
<br><br>
.green[Using the grammar of graphics]

1. The data has to be stored in a dataframe --> .purple[data]
2. We use the function .purple[ggplot] from .purple[ggplot2] R package

<br><br>
```{r , eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_line()
```


---
# Simple example: line plot
<br><br>
.pull-left[
```{r}
data = data.frame( a= 1:10,
                   b = (1:10)*0.3)
head(data)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r , eval = TRUE, fig.width = 3}
ggplot(data, aes(x = a, y = b)) +
  geom_line()  #<<
```
]

---
# Simple example: point plot
<br><br>
.pull-left[
```{r , fig.width = 3}
data = data.frame( a= 1:10,
                   b = (1:10)*0.3)
head(data)

]

# Explanation
<br><br>
- First argument provided is the name of the data, `tb_au`
- Variable mapping: .green[year is mapped to x], .green[count is mapped to y], .green[gender is mapped to colour], and .green[age is used to subset the data and make separate plots]
- The column geom is used, `geom_col`
- We are mostly interested in proportions between gender, over years, separately by age. The `position = "fill"` option in `geom_bar` sets the heights of the bars to be all at 100%. It ignores counts, and emphasizes the proportion of males and females.

---
# The "100% charts"
<br><br>
.content-box-neutral[
- .purple[geom_bar]: .green[makes the height of the bar proportional to the number of cases in each group] (while in .purple[geom_col()] we need to add .purple[position = "fill"] to achieve the same result!
- .purple[stat]: It counts the number of cases at each x position (by default)
- .purple[position = "fill"]
- .purple[scale_fill_brewer(pallet = "Dark2)]: We can use [different palettes](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/scale_brewer.html) 
]

 
[More info about geom_col and geom_bar here]()https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_bar.html 
---
# The "100% charts"
<br><br>
```{r gg-show-100pct, echo=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=2}
ggplot(tb_au, aes(x = year, y = count, fill = gender)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "fill") +  #<<
  facet_grid(~ age) +   #<<
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Dark2")
```


- .purple[geom_bar]: makes the height of the bar proportional to the number of cases in each group. 
- .purple[stat]: It counts the number of cases at each x position (by default).
- .purple[position = "fill] shows relative proportions at each x by stacking the bars and then standardising each bar to have the same height.

# What do we learn?

<br><br>
- Focus is on .green[**proportion**] in each category. 
- Across (almost) all ages, and years, the proportion of males having TB is higher than females
- .green[These proportions tend to be higher in the older age groups, for all years.]
- .green[**It is very important to think about what is the message that we want to convey with a figure!**]

---
# Recap: Code structure of ggplot
<br><br>
- `ggplot()` is the main function
- Plots are constructed in layers
- Structure of code for plots can often be summarised as

```r
ggplot(data = [dataset], 
       mapping = aes(x = [x-variable], 
                     y = [y-variable])) +
   geom_xxx() +
   other options
```

---
# How to use ggplot
<br><br>
- To use .purple[ggplot2] functions, first load .green[tidyverse] library.

```{r example-load}
library(tidyverse)
```

- For help with the ggplot2, see [ggplot2.tidyverse.org](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)

# Let's look at some more options to emphasise different features

---
# Displaying the same graph for different groups:
<br><br>
.left-code[
```{r first-gg-9, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(tb_au,
       aes(x = year, 
           y = count,
           fill = gender))  + 
  geom_col(position = "fill") +
  scale_fill_brewer( 
    palette = "Dark2"
    ) +
  facet_wrap(~ age) #<<
```

]

.right-plot[
```{r first-gg-9-out, ref.label = 'first-gg-9', echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}

```

]

---
# Emphasizing different features with ggplot2
<br><br>
```{r first-gg-10, fig.height = 2, fig.width = 8, out.width = "100%"}
ggplot(tb_au, 
       aes(x = year, 
           y = count, 
           fill = gender))  + 
  geom_col(position = "fill") +
  scale_fill_brewer( palette = "Dark2") +
  facet_grid(~ age) #<<
```

---
# Emphasise ... ?
<br><br>
```{r first-gg-11, fig.height = 2, fig.width = 8, out.width = "100%"}
ggplot(tb_au, 
       aes(x = year, 
           y = count, 
           fill = gender))  + 
  geom_col() + #<<
  scale_fill_brewer( palette = "Dark2") +
  facet_grid(~ age)
```

---
# What do we learn?

<br><br>
- `, position = "fill"` was removed
- Focus is on .green[**counts**] in each .green[category]. 
- Differences across ages, and years, counts tend to be lower in middle age (45-64)
- 1999 saw a bit of an outbreak, in most age groups, with numbers doubling or tripling other years.
- Incidence has been increasing among younger age groups in recent years.

---
# Emphasise ... ?
<br><br>
```{r gg-side-by-side,  fig.height = 2, fig.width = 8, out.width = "100%"}
ggplot(tb_au, 
       aes(x = year, 
           y = count, 
           fill = gender)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") + #<<
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Dark2") +
  facet_grid(~ age)
```  

---
# What do we learn?
<br><br>
- `, position="dodge"` is used in `geom_col`
- Focus is on **counts by gender**, predominantly male incidence.
- Incidence among males relative to females is from middle age on. 
- There is similar incidence between males and females in younger age groups.

---
# Separate bar charts
<br><br>

```{r gg-separate, echo=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=3}
ggplot(tb_au, 
       aes(x = year, y = count, fill = gender)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Dark2") +
  facet_grid(gender ~ age) #<<
```

---
class: transition
# What do we learn?
<br><br>
- `facet_grid(gender ~ age) +` .green[faceted by gender as well as age]
- note `facet_grid` vs `facet_wrap`
- Easier to focus separately on males and females.
- 1999 outbreak mostly affected males.
- Growing incidence in the 25-34 age group is still affecting females but seems to be have stablised for males.

---
# ~~Pie charts?~~ Rose Charts
<br>
```{r gg-rose, echo=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=3}
ggplot(tb_au, 
       aes(x = year, y = count, fill = gender)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Dark2") + 
  facet_grid(gender ~ age) +
  coord_polar() + #<<
  theme(axis.text = element_blank()) #<<
```
<br>
[Polar coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_coordinate_system)
is an alternative system to display points in a plane.

---
# What do we learn?

<br><br>
- Bar charts in .green[polar coordinates] produce .green[rose charts]. 
- `coord_polar() +` plot is made in polar coordinates, rather than the default Cartesian coordinates
- .green[**Emphasizes the middle years as low incidence.**] 

---
# Not a good plot: Rainbow charts

<br>
```{r gg-rainbow, echo=TRUE, out.width = "50%"}
ggplot(tb_au, aes(x = 1, 
                  y = count, 
                  fill = factor(year))) + #<<
  geom_col(position = "fill") +
  facet_grid(gender ~ age) 
```

- A single stacked bar, in each facet. 
-  .green[year is now mapped to colour] (that's what gives us the rainbow charts!)
- Pretty chart but .green[**not**] easy to interpret. 


---
# Not a good plot: (Actual) Pie charts
<br>
```{r gg-pie2, echo=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=3, out.width = "50%"}
ggplot(tb_au, aes(x = 1, y = count, fill = factor(year))) +
  geom_col(position = "fill") +
  facet_grid(gender ~ age) + #<<
  coord_polar(theta = "y") + #<<
  theme(axis.text = element_blank())
```

- `coord_polar(theta="y")`  is using the y variable to do the angles for the polar coordinates to give a pie chart.
- Pretty chart but .green[**not**] easy to interpret, or make comparisons across age groups. 

---
# Visualisation: the plot and the message
<br><br>
.content-box-neutral[
- Different plots give different insight about the data.
- It is important to select the right plot to convey the message that we want to highlight.
- The grammar of graphics allow us to easily customize plots.
- The idea for any kind of plot is always the same: data, x and y axis, type of plot and then
other customization!

# Extracting temporal elements

- Very often we want to know what day of the week it is
- Trends and patterns in data can be quite different depending on the type of day:

  - week day vs. weekend
  - weekday vs. holiday
  - regular saturday night vs. new years eve

# Many ways of saying similar things
<br><br>
- Many ways to specify day of the week:
  - A number. .green[Does 1 mean... Sunday, Monday or even Saturday???]
  - Or text or or abbreviated text. .green[(Mon vs. Monday)]

- Talking with people we generally use.green[day name]:
  - Today is Friday, tomorrow is Saturday vs Today is 5 and tomorrow is 6.
- But, .green[doing data analysis on days might be useful to have it represented as a number]:
  - e.g., Saturday - Thursday is 2 days (6 - 4)

# Distribution of counts

Side-by-side boxplots show the distribution of counts over different temporal elements.

A [boxplot](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_boxplot.html#:~:text=geom_boxplot.Rd,all%20%22outlying%22%20points%20individually.) displays the so called five number summary of a data set: .green[min, first quartile, median, third quartile and max, the whiskers represent 1.5*IQR (interquantile range = 75th quantile - 25th quantile)]
