# Graphical model

<br><br>
.content-box-neutral[
A **graphical model** represents the probabilistic relationships among a set of variables.
]

<br>
- Graphical models allow us to .green[understand "high-order" relationships between variables representing a complex system].
- .green[Graphical models are represented by a network]: each .green[node/vertex (vertices) of the graph represents a variable] and .green[each edge represents the dependency between the variables that are connected by an edge].

---
# How does a graphical model representation look like?


```{r make-call-graph3, echo = FALSE}
simple <- make_graph(c(1,2,1,3,2,3,2,4,3,5), directed = FALSE)
V(simple)$name <- c('Gene1', 'Gene2', 'Gene3', 'Gene4', 'Gene5')

example <- as_tbl_graph(simple)
ggraph(example, layout = 'graphopt') + 
    geom_edge_link(aes(start_cap = label_rect(node1.name),
                       end_cap = label_rect(node2.name)))+ 
    geom_node_text(aes(label = name))

```
The graph represents the .green[network topology] that is how the different
variables in the system connect to each other. Typically relationships represent
dependencies.

---
# Network topology --> Adjacency matrix

<br><br>
The network topology (network connections)
is given by the so called .green[adjacency matrix].

<br>
.pull-left[
```{r, echo = FALSE}
as_adjacency_matrix(simple, sparse = FALSE)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r make-call-graph2, echo = FALSE}
simple <- make_graph(c(1,2,1,3,2,3,2,4,3,5), directed = FALSE)
V(simple)$name <- c('Gene1', 'Gene2', 'Gene3', 'Gene4', 'Gene5')

example <- as_tbl_graph(simple)
ggraph(example, layout = 'graphopt') + 
    geom_edge_link(aes(start_cap = label_rect(node1.name),
                       end_cap = label_rect(node2.name)))+

# Directed and undirected graphs

<br><br>
.pull-left[
# Undirected graph

```{r make-call-graph5, echo = FALSE}
simple <- make_graph(c(1,2,1,3,2,3,2,4,3,5), directed = FALSE)
V(simple)$name <- c('Gene1', 'Gene2', 'Gene3', 'Gene4', 'Gene5')

example <- as_tbl_graph(simple)
ggraph(example, layout = 'graphopt') + 
    geom_edge_link(aes(start_cap = label_rect(node1.name),
                       end_cap = label_rect(node2.name))) + 
    geom_node_text(aes(label = name))
```
]
.pull-right[

# Directed graph
```{r , echo = FALSE}
simple <- make_graph(c(1,2,1,3,2,3,2,4,3,5), directed = TRUE)
V(simple)$name <- c('Gene1', 'Gene2', 'Gene3', 'Gene4', 'Gene5')

example <- as_tbl_graph(simple)
ggraph(example, layout = 'graphopt') + 
    geom_edge_link(aes(start_cap = label_rect(node1.name),
                       end_cap = label_rect(node2.name)), 
                   arrow = arrow(length = unit(4, 'mm'))) + 
    geom_node_text(aes(label = name))

```
]

A directed graph represents the connection and direction of the relationship between variables,  while undirected graphs
represent the connections not the directions (in many cases we will not have information on that).


---
# Nodes and edges

<br><br>

- The .green[edges] in a network representing a graphical model
describe whether there is a .green[relationship between different variables].

- The relationship between variables (or nodes) in a graphical model
can be established by studying conditional probabilities (and also much more complicated models) or more simply
using correlation thresholds between variables.



---
# Knowing/not knowing the network topology

<br><br>

Typically we might encounter two problems:

<br>
- Estimation of the network topology
- If we know the network topology under
the strength of the relationship between the 
variables (i.e the value of the edges)

---
# Graphical models based on correlations
<br>
If we don't know the topology of the network,
we can use correlations to find out the network
describing the relationship between the variables.
More complex methods are typically used!

```{r}
set.seed(120)
variables_df <- data.frame(Gene1 = rnorm(100),
                           Gene2 = rnorm(100),
                           Gene3 = rnorm(100))
head(variables_df)
```

---
# Computing correlations
```{r}
Correlation_matrix<- cor(variables_df)
Correlation_matrix
```
We can create an adjacency matrix:

```{r}
adjacency_matrix <- ifelse(Correlation_matrix <= 0.06, 0, 1)
adjacency_matrix
```
<br>

How does the graph looks like?

---
# Sometimes we know the network topology
<br><br>
**A description of phone calls** and we want
to represent the connections via a network/graph.
In this case, we know the direction of the connections between
the nodes.

## Relationship between group phone calls.
<br>
- Johnny --> Liz
- Liz --> Anna
- Johnny -- > Dan
- Dan --> Liz
- Dan --> Lucy

---
# Network visualization
<br>
Example of directed network:
<br>
```{r make-call-graph, echo = FALSE}
simple <- make_graph(c(1,2,1,3,2,3,2,4,3,5), directed = TRUE)
V(simple)$name <- c('Johnny', 'Dan', 'Liz', 'Lucy', 'Anna')

example <- as_tbl_graph(simple)
ggraph(example, layout = 'graphopt') + 
    geom_edge_link(aes(start_cap = label_rect(node1.name),
                       end_cap = label_rect(node2.name)), 
                   arrow = arrow(length = unit(4, 'mm'))) + 
    geom_node_text(aes(label = name))

```

# Corresponding adjacency matrix

<br><br>
```{r, echo = FALSE}
as_adjacency_matrix(simple, sparse = FALSE)
```
<br>
Is this matrix symmetric? Why?

---
# Examples 

These examples present situations in which
we might be interested to know or to represent how the
different variables connect to each other.

- **Telephone exchanges**: Nodes are the phone numbers. Edges would indicate a call was made betwen two numbers.
- **Book or movie plots**: Nodes are the characters. Edges would indicate whether they appear together in a scene, or chapter. If they speak to each other, various ways we might measure the association.
- **Social media**: nodes would be the people who post on facebook, including comments. Edges would measure who  comments on who's posts.

# Generate a network view

- Create a layout (in 2D) which places nodes which are most related close,
- Plot the nodes as points, connect the appropriate lines
- Overlaying other aspects, e.g. gender

# Introducing `madmen` data

madmen_edges <- as_tibble(madmen$edges) %>% mutate_all(as.character)

```{r make-madmen-graph}

```{r mm-nodes}
madmen_nodes

# Example: Mad Men. (Edges = how they are associated)

```{r mm-edges}

```

---
# Let's get the madmen data into the right shape
<br><br>
```{r}
madmen_edges %>%
  rename(from_id = Name1, to_id = Name2) 
```
<br>
Is this data represented a directed or an undirected graph?

---
# Let's get the madmen data into the right shape

```{r}
madmen_net <- madmen_edges %>%
  rename(from_id = Name1, to_id = Name2) %>%
  full_join(madmen_nodes,  #<<

# Summary 
<br><br>

<br>
