# Tips for asking questions
<br><br>
 - Give your question context from course concept. Be precise in your description:
 
 <br>


   -  **Good description**: "I am getting the following error and I'm not sure how to resolve it" - .green[Error: could not find function ggplot]
     
   -  **Bad description**: "R giving errors, help me! Aaaarrrrrgh!" 
     
   -  .green[Whenever is possible please provide a reproducible example]

<br>    
    
 Remember: In Moodle you can edit a question after posting it.

# An important lesson: 

.blockquote[
Data preparation accounts for about 80% of the work of data scientists 

-- [Gil Press, Forbes 2016](https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2016/03/23/data-preparation-most-time-consuming-least-enjoyable-data-science-task-survey-says/##47cbbbf46f63)

]

## Data Preparation

* One of the least taught parts of data science, and business analytics, and yet it is what data scientists spend most of their time on. 
* By the end of this semester, you will have the tools to be more efficient and effective in this area, so that you have more time to spend on your mining and modeling.

# In detail: 
<br><br>
- __Source code editor__: This is where you edit your script! Experiment with writing your data analysis pipeline, ... You can have multiple files open, there are useful shortcuts (eg "Run", "Knit"), code is highlighted usefully and there is tab-completion when you start typing. *Also, if you want to look at any of the data you have read or created, it can be viewed in a tab on this pane.*
- __Console window__: This is where the code is executed. There is a prompt ">" which says *R is waiting for your command*. You don't actually need to type anything in this pane, you can run code directly from the Editor pane. The functions will show up in this window, and the results will be here. (Although, if you use an R notebook the result will show up in that notebook.)

---
# In detail:
<br><br>
- __Help__: *?function* will show the help pages for the function here.
- __Plot__: Plots you ask R to make will show up here, and you can zoom to make them bigger in a separate window if you want.
- __Environment__: Data that you have read into R, or data or functions that you create will be listed here. **When you quit R, you will be asked if you want to save the environment. I suggest that you always answer NO.** Because we are scripting everything it is always easy to re-create the objects in the environment. The only time it can be useful is if you have created something that took a while, but a better option is to save this object to a file, and read it in at the start of the next R session.

# Rstudio Cloud

<br>
.green[R/Rstudio but in the cloud!]

<br>
```{r rstudio, out.width = "60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/rstudiocloud.png")
```

- Ensure that we all work in the same environment.

---
# R essentials: A short list (for now)
<br><br>
- Data is organized in .green[columns] and .green[rows].

- Typically: .green[columns] --> represent variables
- and .green[rows] --> represent observations.

```{r eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
library(palmerpenguins)
head(penguins)
```

---
# R essentials: A short list (for now)
<br><br>


```{r eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
names(penguins)
```

```{r show-mean, echo = TRUE}
str(penguins)
```


---
# R essentials: A short list (for now)

- Columns (variables) in data frames are accessed with `$`:
```{r species, echo = TRUE}
penguins$species
```
- Elements within the column can be accessed: 
```{r elements, echo = TRUE}
penguins$species[1:10]
```



---
# R essentials: A short list (for now)

<br><br>
- .green[Functions] are (most often) verbs, followed by what they will be applied to in parentheses:

```{r do-what, eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
do_this(to_this)
do_that(to_this, to_that, with_those)
```


For example:


```{r mean-example, echo = TRUE}
mean(c(1,2,1,2))
```


---
# R essentials: A short list (for now)
<br><br>

- Packages are installed with the `install.packages` function and loaded with the `library` function, once per session:

```{r eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
install.packages("package_name")
library(package_name)
```


---

# Sharing / Reusing code

<br><br>
- Any recycled code not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism. 
- This can be as simple as pasting the link in a references section.
- Assignment groups may not directly share/re-use code from  another group. 
- You are welcome to discuss the problems together and ask for advice, 
but you may not make direct use of code from another team.

# Literate programming is a partial solution


<br><br>
- Literate programming shines some light on this dark area of science. 

- An idea from [Donald Knuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth) where you combine your text with your code output to create a document. 

- A _blend_ of your literature (**text**), and your programming (**code**), to create something you can read from top to bottom. 

- .green[** Use R markdown to combine both, text, R code, figures and more!**]

# Markdown as a new player to legibility

<br><br>

In 2004, [John Gruber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gruber), of [daring fireball](https://daringfireball.net/) created [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), a simple way to create text that rendered into a HTML webpage.




---

# Example: 
<br> <br>

Imagine a report:

<br>

Introduction, methods, results, discussion, and conclusion,
and all the bits of code that make each section. 


- With Rmarkdown, you can see all the pieces of your data analysis  together in the same file.

- Each time you knit the analysis is ran from the beginning

# Markdown 

<br><br>

With very little marking up, we can create rich text, that **actually resembles** the text that we want to see.

# Rmarkdown helps address the reproducibility problem

<br><br>

* Q: How do we take `markdown` + `R code` = "literate programming environment"

* A: `Rmarkdown` 

---

# Rmarkdown
<br><br>
- Provides an environment where you can write your complete analysis, and marries your text, and code together into a rich document. 

- You write your code as code chunks, put your text around that, and then hey presto, you have a document you can reproduce.



---

# The anatomy of an Rmarkdown document
<br><br>
.green[**There are three parts to an rmarkdown document.**]

- Metadata (YAML)
- Text (markdown formatting)
- Code (code formatting)



---
# Metadata: YAML  (YAML Ain't Markup Language) 
<br><br>
- The metadata of the document tells you how it is formed - what the **title** is, what **date** to put, and other control information.  

- If you're familiar with $\LaTeX$, this is similar to how you specify document type, styles, fonts, options, etc in the front matter / preamble.

---
# Metadata: YAML
<br><br>
- Rmarkdown documents use YAML to provide the metadata. It looks like this:

```YAML
---
title: "An example document"
author: "Dr Who"
output: html_document
---
```

It starts an ends with three dashes `---`, and has fields like the following: `title`, `author`, and `output`.

---
# Text
<br><br>

Markdown  provides a simple way to mark up text

.pull-left[

```
1. bullet list
2. bullet list
3. bullet list
```

]

.pull-right[

---
# Code and code chunks
<br><br>
.green[We refer to code in an rmarkdown document in two ways]:

1. Code chunks, and 
2. Inline code.

`Code chunks` are marked by three backticks and curly braces with `r` inside them:

````markdown
```{r chunk-name}`r ''`
# a code chunk
```
````

---
# Code: backtick?
<br><br>

**A backtick** is a special character you might not have seen before, it is typically located under the tilde key (`~`). On USA / Australia keyboards, is under the escape key:


```{r show-backtick, out.width = "60%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ansi-keyboard.png")
```

# Code: Inline code

<br><br>
Sometimes you want to run the code inside a sentence. This is called running the code "inline".

You might want to run the code inline to name the number of variables or rows in a dataset in a sentence like:

> There are XXX observations in the airquality dataset, and XXX variables.

---

# Code: Inline code
<br><br>
.green[You can call code "inline"  like so:]


````markdown

There are `r "\u0060r nrow(airquality) \u0060"` observations in the airquality dataset, 
and `r "\u0060r ncol(airquality) \u0060"` variables.

````

Which gives you the following sentence


> There are `r nrow(airquality)` observations in the airquality dataset, and `r ncol(airquality)` variables.

- If your data changes upstream

- You don't need to work out where you mentioned your data

- You just update the document. `r emo::ji("tada")`

# Code: Chunk names
<br><br>
Straight after the ` ```{r ` you can use a text string to name the chunk:

````markdown
```{r read-crime-data}`r ''`
crime <- read_csv("data/crime-data.csv")
```
````

# Code: Chunk names
<br><br>
.green[Naming code chunks has three advantages:]

1. Navigate to specific chunks using the drop-down code navigator in the bottom-left of the script editor.
2. Graphics produced by chunks now have useful names.
3. You can set up networks of cached chunks to avoid re-performing expensive computations on every run.

---
# Code: Chunk names
<br><br>
.green[Every chunk should ideally have a name.]

Naming things is hard, but follow these rules and you'll be fine:

1. One word that describes the action (e.g., "read")
2. One word that describes the thing inside the code (e.g, "gapminder")
3. Separate words with "-" (e.g., `read-gapminder`)

---
# Code: Chunk options
<br><br>
.green[You can control how the code is output by changing the code chunk options which follow the title.] 

````markdown
```{r read-gapminder, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}`r ''`
gap <- read_csv("gapminder.csv")
```
````

What do you think this does?


---
# Code: Chunk options
<br><br>
.green[The code chunk options you need to know about right now are:]

  * `cache`: TRUE / FALSE. Do you want to save the output of the chunk so it doesn't have to run next time?
  * `eval`: TRUE / FALSE Do you want to evaluate the code?
  * `echo`: TRUE / FALSE Do you want to print the code?
  * `include`: TRUE / FALSE Do you want to include code output in the final output document? Setting to `FALSE` means nothing is put into the output document, but the code is still run.

You can read more about the options at the official documentation: https://yihui.name/knitr/options/#code-evaluation


---
# Global options: Set and forget
<br><br>
.green[You can set the default chunk behavior once at the top of the `.Rmd` file using a chunk like:]

```r
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  echo = FALSE,
  cache = TRUE
)
```

then you will only need to add chunk options when you have the occasional one that you'd like to behave differently.
