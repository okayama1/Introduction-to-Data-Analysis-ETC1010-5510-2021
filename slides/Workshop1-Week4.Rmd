# Recap: Tidy data

```{r print-tidy-data-og, out.width = "75%", echo = FALSE}
include_graphics("images/original-dfs-tidy.png")
```


---
# Relational data
<br><br>
- Data analysis .green[**rarely involves**] only a single table of data. 
- To answer questions you generally need to .green[combine many tables of data.]
- Multiple tables of data are called .green[*relational data*.]
- It is the .green[**relations**], not just the individual datasets, that are important.

---
# Example `nycflights13`
<br><br>
- Data set of flights that departed NYC in 2013 from https://www.transtats.bts.gov - a public database of all USA commercial airline flights. It has .green[five tables]:
<br><br>
    1. **flights**
    1. **airlines**
    1. **airports**
    1. **planes**
    1. **weather**

---
# Flights
<br>
```{r print-flights}
library(nycflights13)
names(flights)

head(flights, 3)
```

---
# Airlines
<br>
```{r print-airlines}

names(airlines)
head(airlines, 3)
```

---
# Airports
<br>
```{r print-airports}
names(airports)
head(airports, 3)
```

---
# Planes

<br>
```{r print-planes}
names(planes)
head(planes, 3)
```

---
# weather
<br>
```{r print-weather}
names(weather)
head(weather, 3)
```

---
# Concept map of tables and joins from the text

```{r show-nycflights-graphic, echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%"}
include_graphics("images/relational-nycflights.png")
```

---
# Keys `r ji("key")`
<br><br>
- .green[Keys] = variables used to connect records in one table to another. 
- In the `nycflights13` data, 
.content-box-neutral[

    - `flights` connects to `planes` by a single variable `tailnum`
    - `flights` connects to `airlines` by a single variable `carrier`
    - `flights` connects to `airports` by two variables, `origin` and `dest`
    - `flights` connects to `weather` using multiple variables, `origin`, and `year`,     `month`, `day` and `hour`.
]


---
# Joins: Combine variables 

<br><br>
- Adding variables from one table to another. 
- There is always a decision on what observations are copied to the new table as well. 
- Let's discuss how joins work using some [lovely animations](https://github.com/gadenbuie/tidyexplain) provided by [Garrick Aden-Buie](https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/).

---
# Example data

```{r print-example-data, echo = FALSE, out.width = "75%"}

```

---
#  Left Join (Generally the one you want to use)

.left-code[
<br>
.green[**All**] observations from the .green[**left** table], but .green[only] the observations from the .green[**right** table] that match those in the left.

]

.right-plot[

```{r animate-left-join, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
include_graphics("gifs/left-join.gif")
```
]

---
# Right Join

.left-code[
<br><br>
Same as left join, but in .green[**reverse**].
]

.right-plot[
```{r animate-right-join, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
include_graphics("gifs/right-join.gif")
```
]

---
# Inner join

.left-code[
<br>
.green[Intersection] between the two tables, .green[**only the observations that are in both**]
]

.right-plot[
```{r animate-inner-join, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
include_graphics("gifs/inner-join.gif")
```
]

---
# Outer (full) join

.left-code[
<br>
.green[Union] of the two tables, .green[**all observations from both**], .green[and missing values might get added]
]

.right-plot[
```{r animate-full-join, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
include_graphics("gifs/full-join.gif")

---
# Combine full airline name with flights data?

<br><br>

```{r print-flights-again}
names(flights)

```

---
# Combine full airline name with flights data?


```{r print-airlines-again}
names(airlines)
head(airlines, 3)
```

---
# Combine `airlines` & `flights` using `left_join()`

.left-code[
<br>
```{r join-flights-airlines, eval = FALSE}

  left_join(airlines, 
            by = "carrier") %>%
  glimpse()

# Colour blindness
<br><br>
- About 8% of men (about 1 in 12), and 0.5% women (about 1 in 200) population have difficulty distinguishing between red and green. 
- Several colour blind tested palettes: .green[RColorbrewer] has an associated web site [colorbrewer.org](http://colorbrewer2.org) where the palettes are labelled. See also `viridis`, and `scico`.

# Two different arrangements
<br>
- To answer the question .green["Is the incidence similar for males and females in 2012 across age groups?"] the first arrangement is better. 
- It puts males and females right beside each other, so the relative heights of the bars can be seen quickly. The answer to the question would be "No, the numbers were similar in youth, but males are more affected with increasing age."

- The second arrangement puts the .green[focus on age groups], and is better to answer the question "Is the incidence similar for age groups in 2012, across gender?"
- To which the answer would be "No, among females, the incidence is higher at early ages. For males, the incidence is much more uniform across age groups."


---
# "Incidence similar for M & F in 2012 across age?"
<br><br>
```{r gg-fill-gender-print, fig.width=8, fig.height=2, echo = FALSE}
gg_fill_gender
```
<br>
- Males & females next to each other: .green[relative heights of bars is seen quickly]. 
- .green[**Question answer:**] "No, the numbers were similar in youth, but males are more affected with increasing age."

---
# "Incidence similar for age in 2012, across gender?"

```{r gg-fill-age-print, fig.width=8, fig.height=2, echo = FALSE}

# Proximity wrap up
<br><br>
- .green[Facetting of plots and proximity]  --> are related to change blindness, an area of study in cognitive psychology.

on how the mind processes it by Daniel Simons lab.

# Layering
<br><br>
- .green[*Statistical summaries:*] It is common to layer plots, particularly
by adding statistical summaries, like a model fit, or means and standard
deviations. The purpose is to show the **trend** in relation to the **variation**. 
- .green[*Maps:*] Commonly maps provide the framework for data collected spatially. 
One layer for the map, and another for the data.

```{r smooth-later, echo = FALSE}
df <- tibble(
  x = runif(100),
  y1 = 4 * x + rnorm(100),
  y2 = -x + 10 * (x - 0.5)^2 + rnorm(100)
)
```

---
# `geom_point()`
<br><br>
```{r point-1}
ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y1)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw()
```

---
# `geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)`
<br><br>
```{r point-2}
ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y1)) + geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
